            />
            Have 3 to 4 volunteers ready to help out with sorting. You will also
            need to have the order sheets and packing slip/shipping information
            with you. If you are going to have extras, put up a sign letting
            people know what you have left for sale.
          </ul>

          <ArrowRightIcon
              style={{ verticalAlign: "middle", marginRight: "10px" }}
            />
          When your delivery arrives, count your items before signing the
          driver’s waybill. Make sure the numbers match what is on your packing
          slip/shipping information document and that none of the cases are
          damaged. If there are discrepancies in the numbers, make sure the
          driver writes the difference/damage on the waybill before signing. You
          will be responsible for any discrepancies if you do not note them on
          the driver’s waybill.
           </ul>
           <ul>
           <ArrowRightIcon
              style={{ verticalAlign: "middle", marginRight: "10px" }}
            />
           Before starting to hand out the product (s) make
          sure that your packing slip matches what was delivered in regard to
          boxes ordered per flavour. If there are any discrepancies at this
          point, please call us immediately to let us know (1-877-463-3946).
          </ul>
          <ul>
          <ArrowRightIcon
              style={{ verticalAlign: "middle", marginRight: "10px" }}
            />
          Sort the flavours in separate stacks leaving space between the
          flavours. It is best to arrange them in the same order that is on the
          order form.
           </ul>

           <ArrowRightIcon
           style={{ verticalAlign: "middle", marginRight: "10px" }}

           When handing out the products, have only the selected
          volunteers do the picking and sorting of the orders.
